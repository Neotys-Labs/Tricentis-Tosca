# NeoLoad Add-on for Tricentis Tosca

## Overview

C# extension to integrate [Tricentis Tosca](https://www.tricentis.com/) with [NeoLoad](https://www.neotys.com/neoload/overview) for SAP GUI and Web Script maintenance.
It allows you to interact with the NeoLoad [Design API](https://www.neotys.com/documents/doc/neoload/latest/en/html/#11265.htm) to convert a Tricentis Tosca SAP GUI or Web script to a NeoLoad User Path or update an existing User Path.

## Setting up the NeoLoad Tricentis Tosca Add-on

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/Tricentis-Tosca/releases/latest) for your Tricentis Tosca version (either 12.1 and below or 12.2 and above).

2. Unzip it in the root folder of the Tricentis Tosca installation directory (for example: C:\Program Files (x86)\TRICENTIS\Tosca Testsuite\).

3. Unblock the following 3 DLL files by right clicking the DLL > Properties and tick **Unblock**
	* TRICENTIS\Tosca Testsuite\TBox\NeoLoadTBoxAddOn.dll
	* TRICENTIS\Tosca Testsuite\TBox\NeoloadTBoxProxy.dll
	* TRICENTIS\Tosca Testsuite\ToscaCommander\NeoLoadToscaCommanderAddOn.dll

4. Relaunch the Tosca Commander.

**Warning**: For SAP test case, you might need to launch both Tosca and SAP Logon as administrator in order to convert the Tosca Script to NeoLoad.

## Global Configuration

Go to **PROJECT** > **Options**, to define the NeoLoad Add-on settings:

<p align="center"><img src="/screenshots/options.png" alt="Options" /></p>

Parameters: 
* **NeoLoadApiPort**: The port of the NeoLoad API, by default it is 7400. 
* **NeoLoadApiKey**: The API Key specified in the NeoLoad project when identification is required. If no identification is required, this parameter can be left blank.
* **NeoLoadApiHostname**: The hostname of the machine that contains NeoLoad, by default it is localhost. It should be localhost for SAP GUI test case.
* **CreateTransactionBySapTCode**: Enable/Disable the creation of transaction in Neoload for each SAP TCode.

To access these values, go to the NeoLoad **Preferences**, then the **Project settings** tab, then select the **REST API** category.

### When enterprise proxy is set
During any transfer from Tosca to Neoload, the enterprise proxy settings must be disabled so that Neoload can manage the system proxy temporarily to record the network traffic generated by the Tosca test.
Before the transfer, go to windows proxy settings. Set "Automatically detect settings" and "Use setup script" to Off as shown below.
After the transfer complete, reset the settings at their initial value.

## How to convert a Tricentis Tosca SAP script to a NeoLoad User Path

The NeoLoad Controller used to convert the Tosca SAP script must be 32 bits and launched in process mode (service mode is not supported). More information about NeoLoad Prerequisites for SAP GUI on [NeoLoad documentation](https://www.neotys.com/documents/doc/neoload/latest/en/html/#27113.htm).

In Tricentis Tosca, right click on an execution of a Test Case and then **NeoLoad Add-on > Transfer SAP test case to NeoLoad**
Neoload starts the **SAP recording** at the first step named "SAP" or "SAP Login", and stops it at the end of the test case.

## How to convert a Tricentis Tosca Web or API script to a NeoLoad User Path

In Tricentis Tosca, right click on an execution of a Test Case and then **NeoLoad Add-on > Transfer Web test case to NeoLoad**
Neoload starts the **Web recording** at the beginning of the test case, and stops it at the end.

## User Path Update

During the execution of the Tricentis Tosca test case, if the NeoLoad User Path does not exist, it will be created. Otherwise, the existing User Path will be updated thanks to the User Path Update feature.
The User Path Update feature merges the original User Path with a newer recording, copying variable extractors and variables. Below the SAP GUI User Path in NeoLoad.

## Troubleshooting
From Tosca version 12.2, if execution errors are not displayed in Tosca Commander (Loginfo column displays "Stack empty."), check file **neoload-add-on-error.txt** located in your user profile directory (for example C:\Users\<username>\neoload-add-on-error.txt).

### Unable to connect to the remote server (No connection can be established to 127.0.0.1:7400)
Make sure NeoLoad is running, on same host specified by IP address (127.0.0.1 for localhost), and make sure NeoLoad design API is listening on port specified (by default 7400). 

### NL-DESIGN-CANNOT-GET-CONTAINS-USER-PATH (No project is opened.)
NeoLoad is running, but there is no project open. Make sure to wait until project is fully loaded in NeoLoad before converting Tosca script.

### NL-DESIGN-CANNOT-START-SAP-RECORDING (There is no active SAP connection)
The API call sent from the NeoLoad add-on to the NeoLoad Controller Design API was performed when there was no active SAP connection. 
Make sure there is an active SAP connection when the conversion starts. If needed, adjust name of test case actions to allow a delayed start. The add-on will trigger the "Start SAP recording" either on action pre-execution or post-execution, as coded [here](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/Tricentis-Tosca/blob/master/NeoloadTBoxProxy/listener/TestActionListener.cs).
